    <h1><strong>bucket list</strong></h1>

    <br>My first dream list is
    In France, in the morning, you get freshly baked rigassant, pain au chocolat, and baguette!
    <br>Favorite program these days
    'Welcome to Korea for the first time' in France
    It is said that there is a place in Europe that sells meal bread and cafes!!
    <br> The fact that they are related to each other! So, in the case of a bakery that sells meal bread,
    I make bread from 1:00 a.m, 4:00 a.m, 5:00 a.m. 
    <br> Say you're opening a bakery
   
    <p style="margin-top: 20px;"><img src="bread.jpg" width="500px"></p>
    
    <p> So, on the day I play as a clown at night and go home in the future,
    Don't be smart knocking on the back door of a bakery like this.<br>If you buy fresh bread 
    He said he was feeling really happy.</p>
